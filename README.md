# The Hugging Face Course ğŸ¤—

This repo contains the codes written during my exploration of the Hugging Face course. The course teaches about applying Transformers to various tasks in natural language processing and beyond. Along the way, I learnt how to use the Hugging Face ecosystem â€” ğŸ¤— Transformers, ğŸ¤— Datasets, ğŸ¤— Tokenizers, and ğŸ¤— Accelerate â€” as well as the Hugging Face Hub.
