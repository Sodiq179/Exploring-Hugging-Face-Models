## Working with pipelines:

The most basic object in the ðŸ¤— Transformers library is the `pipeline()` function. It connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer:

There are three main steps involved when you pass some text to a pipeline:

1. The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.
2. The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.
3. The predictions of the model are post-processed, so you can make sense of them.


Some of the currently available pipelines:

- `feature-extraction` (get the vector representation of a text)
- `fill-mask`
- `ner` (named entity recognition)
- `question-answering`
- `sentiment-analysis`
- `summarization`
- `text-generation`
- `translation`
- `zero-shot-classification`

Let's have a look at a few of these!

## Zero-shot classification
```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
classifier(
    "This is a course about the Transformers library",
    candidate_labels=["education", "politics", "business"],
)
```

```python out
{'sequence': 'This is a course about the Transformers library',
 'labels': ['education', 'business', 'politics'],
 'scores': [0.8445963859558105, 0.111976258456707, 0.043427448719739914]}
```

## Text generation

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation")
generator("In this course, we will teach you how to")
```

```python out
[{'generated_text': 'In this course, we will teach you how to understand and use '
                    'data flow and data interchange when handling user data. We '
                    'will be working with one or more of the most commonly used '
                    'data flows â€” data flows of various types, as seen by the '
                    'HTTP'}]
```
