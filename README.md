# The Hugging Face Course 🤗

This repo contains the codes written during my exploration of the Hugging Face course. The course teaches about applying Transformers to various tasks in natural language processing and beyond. Along the way, I learnt how to use the Hugging Face ecosystem — 🤗 Transformers, 🤗 Datasets, 🤗 Tokenizers, and 🤗 Accelerate — as well as the Hugging Face Hub.

## Overview of NLP

NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.

The following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples of each:

- **Classifying whole sentences**: Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam
- **Classifying each word in a sentence**: Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization)
- **Generating text content**: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words
- **Extracting an answer from a text**: Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context
- **Generating a new sentence from an input text**: Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text
